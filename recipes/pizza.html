    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve sugar in warm water. Sprinkle yeast over the top, and let stand for about 10 minutes, until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center, and pour in yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix well using a wooden spoon, then turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. Shape into a ball. Place dough in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for a few minutes, and divide in half. Shape into two balls. Place on a nonstick baking sheet, and cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the pizza crust. Add grated cheese, and desired toppings. Bake in preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
